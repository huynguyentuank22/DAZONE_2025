**2. About LOICHOI**

We're **LOICHOI Team**, a group of high school friends who entered this competition together.

Back in 2024, our journey unfortunately ended in Round 1. But we returned in 2025, and were incredibly surprised by our results, making it all the way to the end of the contest. Honestly, this was our first time reaching the finals and presenting our product on stage. We are very thankful for this unique chance we've been given during our student years.

Through this competition, we gained invaluable knowledge in the data world, from preprocessing &rarr; visualization &rarr; gaining insights &rarr; modeling &rarr; proposing suitable actions for problems. We also received excellent feedback from our mentors and examiners, who praised our analytical, logical, and systems thinking skills.
